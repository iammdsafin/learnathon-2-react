## Discussion

**Key Takeaways:**
* Official project work will start from December 01
* Teamwork is necessary
* Final project is expected to be assigned on January 01

**Real Project Implementation**
Program starts from December 01, 2023. 
3 different projects[^1] that focus on real life implementations. Projects that can be added to personal profile (i.e. GitHub/CV). It will be deadline based. Group cooperation is imperative, regardless of the group division. Mentors will supervise the project as task assignments on platforms such as **Trello**, **Jira** etc. Learners will complete the task and push work into Git. Focus on maintaining network for better cooperation and functionality.

It is recommended to follow these steps:

1. Try completing a project by yourself first
2. Seek help from Groupmates/Learnathon 2.0 members 
3. Think and implement ways you can improve the projects from the discussion
4. Finally, consult mentors with the result on further improvements that might be necessary for the project to have a proper structure

*The most important thing that is going to be observed during the whole program is the effort, persistence and the solving approach to the problem rather than a project being solid or just being good entirely.* 

[^1]: This is tentative, the final project amount may vary depending on the circumstances.

## React Discussion

**Key Takeaways:**
* Take reference from [React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn) as much as possible
* Keep doing small projects to grasp concepts
* Study React hooks and components

The React Framework should be implemented in projects within this week to have a better understanding of it before the NextJS classes. The React documentation is a very useful source to learn and implement concepts for a project. It is recommend to go through it before addressing any other resources (i.e. YouTube Tutorials).

**Things to look into for React**:
1. How to setup a React project
2. Scaffolding projects using [Vite Engine](https://vitejs.dev/) for faster developments
3. Routing in React
4. Hooks in React
5. Must learn [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) and [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)
6. Learn components in React
7. Learn how APIs work and are used in React ([cache](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache#noun-labs-1201738-(2)), [memo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) etc.)
8. Use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) for implementation simplicity

## NextJS Overview

**Key Takeaways:**
* Refer to the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for help
* Class will be held next week Thursday
You can check NextJS out only if you are comfortable enough with React and want to catch up with the next class.
